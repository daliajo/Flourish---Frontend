# Flourish – Frontend🪷

Flourish is a simple and calm self-care and planning web application🌿.  
This repository contains the **frontend part only**, developed as part of my internship and learning process, with a focus on clean UI, responsiveness, and good user experience.

The goal of the project is to create a soft, minimal interface that helps users feel organized without feeling overwhelmed.
